Let W be the color on the line, B be the color off the line. 

The car has 3 LDRs ordered from left to right in front of the car's wheels. They are spaced slightly more than the thickness of the tape. 

By default, the car should be in WBW state. (1)

If it goes into a WWW state, then that either means it's tilted slightly off the line (LDRs slightly more spaced than the tape) or that it's off the line (and we need to turn 180 degrees). We move further a little bit, and if nothing changes, then we rotate 180 degrees. (2)

If the left LDR is triggered, then we're tilted slightly to the right and we should tilt a bit to the left. (3)

If the right LDR is triggered, we're tilted slightly left and we should tilt right a bit. (4)

If both the center and right LDRs are triggered, then we should turn right since we're at a corner now. (5)

In state (2) we can customize the buffer

In state (3) and (4), we should tilt left until the center LDR is back on track.
